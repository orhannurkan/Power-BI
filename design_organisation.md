# Tasks identification and distribution

- [x] Explore the data quality and fix eventual problems. Works on it: **Sara**

- [x] Keep a written report updated of the project design, organisation and progression. Works on it: **Sara**

- [x] Setting Power BI:    

   - [x] Set the data in the desktop version and share it with those using only the online version (see planning).  Works on it: **Orhan**
   - [x] Explore the data: variable values (quantitative and qualitative), first groupings, first descriptions. Works on it: **Orhan**
   - [x] Calendar and map functionalities for datetime and location. Works on it: **Opap's**
  

- [x] List of questions and analysis. See [brainstorming](https://github.com/silventesa/accenture_usecase/blob/master/brainstorming.md)!

   - [x] STEP 1
    - [x] Q1: Which are the days (Mo-Sun) with highest amount of orderings? Works on it: **Opap's**

    - [x] Q2: At which time slot more orderings are made? Works on it: **Orhan**
    
      - [x] Q2.1. How many items are ordered in this time slot? Number of items per order. Get mean and std.

      - [x] Q2.2. What is the total price of orderings made at this time slot? Total price of ordering. Get mean and std.

    Questions from 1 to 2 can be analysed from a top-down approach, so we'll have data for:

    - global/ general
    - cities
    - if relevant, streets.

   - [x] STEP 2
   Now that we have the information about the best moment for orderings, we could go further into Customers and Restaurant characteristics.

    - [x] Customers: Characterise curstomers in this gold time slot: age, gender, (language?), allergies (quantity and severity). Works on it: **Opap's**

    <s>- [ ] Restaurants: Characterise restaurants: items that are more ordered and price. Works on it: Orhan </s> **Future work**

- [x] Decide a data mode visualization (e.g., speciific kind of graph/chart/table) for each answer to each question. Works on it: **all**

- [x] Explore visualization options to present the data model
   - Draw.io. Works on it: **Sara**
   
- [x] Build the presentation:
  - [x] Slides: presentation of the whole project, including the context, dataset, data model and data report. Works on it: **Sara**
  - [x] PowerBI: Results of Step 1. Works on it: **Orhan**
  - [x] PowerBI: Results of Step 2. Works on it: **Opap's**
