# Accenture Use Case: PLANNING 


## Tuesday 13

#### Organisation

After the brainstorming session, we settle 1 collective objective and 3 individual tasks:

- **Collective objective**: come up with specific questions for the main, broad questions that will lead our analyses and reports (see [brainstorming](https://github.com/silventesa/accenture_usecase/blob/master/brainstorming.md)!
- **Individual tasks**:
  * **Opap's**: Calendar and map functionalities for datetime and location
  * **Orhan**: Explore the data (variable values (quantitative and qualitative), first groupings, first descriptions, etc.)
  * **Sara**: Update files after the meeting + explore data visualization options (Draw.io)

#### Initial plan

- Comment the summary of Monday and make decisions about this.
- Brainstorming session (see the README file); Opap's could share his screen so we can do a collective brainstorming (following a nice recommendation from Xavier).
- Comment on number of tasks and their distribution among group members

After our meeting, we should have settled:

- Who? What? Actions?
- Work distribtuion


## Monday 12

- Accenture's presentation
- Set up the data
- Get familiarized with the task to do and the required tools (Power BI)

**Summary**: 
Power BI has a desktop and an online version that differ in the functionalities that are available for the user. The online version does not allow to build  table relationships. Bearing this in mind, a way to proceed is the following (thanks to Joachim):
1. Once one person (Opap's?) has managed to get the data in the desktop app, he can publish it on Power BI service.
2. It will appear on the **default workspace** (but you can also create one for the occasion). Then, it will appear on the web app (Power BI service). 
3. You search in the left menu your dataset, and click on the three dots on the right to manage the permissions. Then you can invite your team mates using their **becode address**. 
4. Then it is possible for them to get the data from this shared dataset by selecting "Build one existing datasets - Published datasets".
5. It may also be possible to share whole workspaces, which could be useful to share reports as well. If the only tools we use are those to create reports, it may be enough.
