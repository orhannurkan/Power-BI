## Day 2_First brainstorming

* Client: Platform holders. 
	What would be the main targets they would be interested in?
	- Adds in cities
	- Adds to customers
		- gender
		- language : dutch & english
		- allergies 

* Top-down approach: from more general (dashboard) to more specific (pages)
	Filters:	
		- cities
		- gender
		- creation date: check the oldest
		- price 
		- opening hours
		- allergy
			* allergy type
			* allergy severity

* Possible big topics:
	- CUSTOMER LOYALTY
	- BETTER BUSINESS EXPANSION (geographical part matters)
		* Should the platform target more restaurants in one city than in others?
		* What are the best customers?
	- BETTER SERIVCE TO CLIENTS (here, restaurants)
		* Should you higher/lower your price?
		* Should you add more allergy-dree dishes (taking into account the number of allergies in your city/street?)

Opap's brainstorming

- Display calendar with customer birthdays: take benefit of it for adds --> FUTURE ACTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY
- Growth of number of customers and restaurants throughout time --> GROWTH OF THE COMPANY
- For restaurants: % of orderings they are missing because of their opening hours
	* Do your customers order outside when you're closed?
	* Price: is it price a barrier for customers to order other items? Are restaurants too cheap? Too expensive?
- Insights on the most ordered dish in each restaurant
- Number of orderings x customer
- Number of items x ordering x customer

Orhan's brainstorming

- Which streets have the highest customer/restaurant counts?

## Day1_Draft: example of questions

### TABLES

#### T1: RESTAURANTS

#### T2: ORDER

##### Getting know restaurants

1. _Insights on the ordering rates by city_
2. _Insights on the ordering rates by opening-hours_


##### Getting know customers
1. _Number of ordering per customers_
   
    - Relationship between customers and ordering items (e.g., do those that consume the most share similar tastes?)
    

2. _Identifying the dreamed customers_

What is better (= more economically wortwhile), a customer with more commands but less items or viceversa?
    
- **Top10**: Which and how are the best customers? How many are there? Fix a threshold (percentile?)
        - Gender
        - City
        - Age
        - Language (?)
    
- **Customers loyalty**: Among best customers, how is their relationship with restaurants? Do they often repeat in the same restaurant or do they prefer variety? 
        * If they prefer repeating, do they always order the same?
        * If they do NOT repeat in the same restaurant, do they stay in the same city though?

   
#### T3: ORDER TABLES

1. _Freak idea_

- Check for restaurants or order table names containing "vege" or "vegg" (vegetarian, veggie, etc.) and relate it with customer profiles.

#### T4: ORDER ITEMS


#### T5: CUSTOMER

#### T6: CUSTOMER ALLERGIES

1. Gradient of allergies and number of orderings
    - Do customers with allergies order less than customers with allergies? (allergies vs. non-allergies)
    - Do customers with less allergies order more than customers with more allergies? (+/- num of allergies)
    - Do customers with less SEVERE allergies order more than customers with more severe allergies? (+/- severity of allergies)
    
    1.2. Do age or gender play a role in this relationships? 
    - Here it would be important to control for the effect of age; for example, younger people could be more prone to online deliveroos than older people.
