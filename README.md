# _FOOD ON THE GO_ PROJECT

## What is this?

A data report about the flow of orderings across day times in the online food ordering service **Food On The Go (FOTG)**.

## Where does it come from?

This project was carried out in October 2020 in the context of the course Bouman 2.22 organized by BeCode, a network of inclusive coding bootcamps.

As data science learners, we were assigned a **use case** from the **Accenture** company, which provided us with a dataset belonging to the (fictitious) online food ordering platform FOTG. 

## Who's there?

Three learners and collaborators elaborated the project contained in this repo: [Orhan Nurkan](https://github.com/orhannurkan), [Opap's Ditudidi](https://github.com/Cassik6) and [Sara Silvente](https://github.com/silventesa).

## Dataset

This dataset belongs to the (fictitious) **Food On The Go** company, which provides online meal ordering services. 

The datasets contain information about 3 big and interrelated blocks, namely the **restaurants** delivering food, the **orderings** and the **customers**.

We are asked to get interesting insights from the data that can be informative to clients, which can be either the restaurant holders, the customers or the platform holders.
