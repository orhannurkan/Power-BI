# _FOOD ON THE GO_ PROJECT

## What is this?

A data report about the flow of orderings across day times in the online food ordering service **Food On The Go (FOTG)**. 
## Where does it come from?

This project was carried out in October 2020 in the context of the course Bouman 2.22 organized by BeCode, a network of inclusive coding bootcamps.

As data science learners, we were assigned a **use case** from the **Accenture** company, which provided us with a dataset belonging to the (fictitious) online food ordering platform FOTG. 

Using [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) was a requierement of this project.

## Who's there?

Three learners and collaborators elaborated the project contained in this repo: [Orhan Nurkan](https://github.com/orhannurkan), [Opap's Ditudidi](https://github.com/Cassik6) and [Sara Silvente](https://github.com/silventesa).

### Dataset

This dataset belongs to the (fictitious) **Food On The Go** company, an online meal ordering service.

The data included information about the orderings made by costumers during the months of April and May 2017.

The dataset contains 7 csv files upon which a series of data relationships (view [this document](https://github.com/silventesa/accenture_usecase/blob/master/fotg_powerBI.pdf) for more details) were settled.
